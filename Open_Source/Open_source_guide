Step 1: Forking a repository
The first step is to fork the open-source project's repository. Forking creates a personal copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

Visit the project's GitHub repository. (I am using Open-source Practice Repo.)

Click the Fork button in the upper right corner and fill in the details.

You'll now have your copy of the project in your GitHub account.



Step 2: Creating a branch
Before you start making changes, it's good practice to create a new branch. This isolates your work from the main project and makes it easier to manage your contributions.

Navigate to your forked repository.

Click the Branch button.

Click the New branch button and enter a name for your branch.

Give your branch a descriptive name, e.g., feature/add-my-name.




Step 3: Making changes
Here comes the exciting part! You can now make changes to the project in your branch. It could be anything from fixing a bug to adding a feature. For this example, we'll add our name to the list of contributors.

Navigate to the branch you created earlier.

Look for the contributors folder in the root directory and click on it.

Click on the names.md file.

Click the Edit button.

Add your name to the list of contributors.

Click Commit changes.

Enter a descriptive commit message.

Click Commit changes.



Step 4: Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Once you're satisfied with your changes, it's time to submit a Pull Request to the original project. This is how you propose your changes for inclusion.

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

Click on the Pull Request tab.

Click New Pull Request. (You might also see a Compare & pull request button.)

Select the branch you created earlier.

Describe your changes and why they should be merged.

Click Create Pull Request.
