Which programming language should I do first?

"This is a question that every coder encounters during their programming journey. I am here to guide you through it based on my own programming experience, so let's get started."

I began my coding journey in November last year. When I started, I had to figure out which programming language, to begin with, a question that every coder faces. I knew, as a programmer it is important to learn more than one programming language. I considered C, C++, Python, and Java, I initially considered C, but I was under the impression that it’s no longer widely used in the industry. However, I’ve since learned that C is still a vital tool in many industries, including IoT applications, compiler development, operating system design, database creation, and more. So, I’ve decided to keep it as an option along with my other three choices.: Python, C++, or Java.

Now, I came across information stating that Python has many libraries that make it easier compared to C++ and Java. However, I reasoned that if Python is easier and I become accustomed to it, it might be difficult for me to learn C++ or Java afterward due to the differences. So, I narrowed down my options to C++ and Java.

Interestingly, I discovered Kunal Kushwaha's Java course, and my seniors highly recommended it for learning data structures and algorithms (DSA). With a great course and a good teacher, I made up my mind to try learning Java. And that's how I reached my decision.

Believe me, up until now, I have no regrets.

That's all for now!
